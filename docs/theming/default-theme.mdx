# Default Theme

The theme object is where you define your application's color palette, ui, box-shadow, font stacks, breakpoints, border radius values, and more.

# Colors
Add a colors object to provide colors for your project. By default these colors can be referenced by the color, borderColor, backgroundColor, fill, stroke, styles.

We recommend adding a palette that ranges from 50 to 900.
